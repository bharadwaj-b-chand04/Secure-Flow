**Continuous Behavior-Based Authentication for Mobile Banking**

SecureFlow is a next-gen mobile security system that continuously verifies user identity based on unique behavioral and sensor patterns. By analyzing how users naturally interact with their device, SecureFlow offers zero-friction, on-device protection against session hijacking, fraud, and social engineering attacks.

## 🚨 Problem

Most mobile banking apps only authenticate at login. This leaves open sessions vulnerable to:

- Stolen credentials  
- Session hijacking  
- Automated or social-engineered fraud  

Once logged in, attackers can transfer funds, access sensitive data, or drain accounts—without triggering further checks.

---

## ✅ Solution: SecureFlow

SecureFlow introduces **continuous, behavior-based authentication** by combining:

- Physical interaction patterns  
- Session usage habits  
- Sensor-based signatures  
- Real-time risk scoring  

This ensures that the person using the app is always the genuine user—without hurting UX or draining battery.

## 🧠 Core Features

### 1. **Behavioral Profiling**
- Tracks login frequency, session duration, time-of-day usage  
- Builds adaptive personal thresholds (e.g., adjusts for travel)

### 2. **Keystroke & Gesture Dynamics**
- Monitors typing speed, tap force, swipe fluidity  
- Detects robotic or unfamiliar inputs

### 3. **Navigation & Session Flow**
- Learns typical app flow  
- Detects abnormal routes (e.g., direct to “Transfer Funds”)

### 4. **Transaction Habit Tracker**
- Flags abnormal amounts, new recipients, or rapid withdrawals

### 5. **Location & Context Patterns**
- Uses GPS and network zones  
- Detects "teleporting" or inconsistent geolocation activity

### 6. **Hand-Tremor Micro Signature**
- Leverages accelerometer and gyroscope for subtle motion fingerprinting

### 7. **Secret Panic Gesture**
- Triple-pressing volume or other triggers silent re-auth or lock

### 8. **Decoy Screen Challenge**
- For sensitive actions, presents a fake screen  
- Detects abnormal interaction → session lockdown

### 9. **Adaptive Risk Engine**
- Computes a real-time risk score  
- Responds with:  
  - ✅ Continue silently  
  - 🔐 Ask for biometric/OTP  
  - 🔒 Lock session or block transaction

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React Native (with Native Modules)  
- **ML Engine**: TensorFlow Lite (on-device anomaly detection)  
- **Backend**: Node.js + Firebase (logs & federated updates)  
- **Storage**: SQLite (on-device profiles), AES-256 encryption  
- **Security**: SSL/TLS for network communications

---

## 🌍 Impact

SecureFlow silently protects users by learning *how* they behave—not *what* they do.

- ✅ Ideal for elderly, frequent travelers, high-risk users  
- ✅ Protects privacy with local-only behavior modeling  
- ✅ SDK-ready for fintech and wallet integrations

---

## 🔭 Future Scope

- **Federated Learning**: Improves models without sharing raw data  
- **Cross-Platform SDK**: Drop-in module for fintech apps  
- **Multimodal Biometrics**: Adds voice, facial motion, wearables  
- **Privacy Dashboards**: Ensures DPDP, GDPR, PCI-DSS compliance
